{"text":"Okay. As an experienced cook, I'll give you a quick rundown of foods that I keep on hand. **Pantry**: all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, honey, baking soda, baking powder, cornmeal, cocoa powder, dried beans (these vary, but usually include black beans, chickpeas, and lentils -- you can sub canned beans if you like), canned tomatoes, tomato paste, tuna, olive oil, grapeseed oil, salad vinegar (usually wine vinegar &amp; balsamic), grains (at least rice and oats, usually a few more), pasta (penne, spaghetti, couscous), tortillas (both corn and wheat), dried fruit, nuts (almonds, walnuts), peanut butter, hot sauce, onions, garlic, potatoes **Fridge:** maple syrup, mustard, mayonnaise, jam, olives, milk, eggs, butter, yeast, cheese (at least cheddar and parmesan), vegetables (these vary but I almost always have carrots, celery, bell peppers, broccoli, and salad greens on hand), fruits (seasonal, right now apples and grapes) **Freezer:** vegetables (peas, edamame, spinach, mixed vegetables), fruit (berries mostly), bone-in chicken breasts, fish (cod, tilapia, etc.), home-made chicken stock **Spices:** salt, pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, bay leaves, cloves, ginger, smoked paprika, cumin, cloves, nutmeg **In the outdoor herb garden:** basil, thyme, sage, marjoram, oregano, parsley, chives, rosemary Obviously, this is not all I keep around for preparing meals, but if you were to peruse my kitchen on any given day, you're pretty much guaranteed to find at least the above.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

{"text":"1.Do I need to reduce pan temperature? Is full heat going to be too much, or will full heat just affect the outer part instead of inside? Keep you Pan hot at first when you grill the skin then reduce it to medium. Just like GrandmaGos said you should then relax. Put a lid on your pan for about 2-3 minutes. Then flip/turn your salmon filet as your recipe says. 2.Frying pan or grill? Does it actually make a real difference, besides aesthetics? Frying pan is probably easiest. 3.Do I need to cover the salmon with a pan or aluminum foil? Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

Is full heat going to be too much, or will full heat just affect the outer part instead of inside? Keep you Pan hot at first when you grill the skin then reduce it to medium. Just like GrandmaGos said you should then relax. Put a lid on your pan for about 2-3 minutes. Then flip/turn your salmon filet as your recipe says. 2.Frying pan or grill? Does it actually make a real difference, besides aesthetics? Frying pan is probably easiest. 3.Do I need to cover the salmon with a pan or aluminum foil? Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point. Good luck on your dinner!\n'''","response":"DISH: salmon filet\nEQUIPMENT: pan, lid\nINGREDIENT: salt, pepper"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"Everyone will have different needs (obvious from the posts below). How comfortable are you with cooking? Do you enjoy cooking (if you do you will want more kitchen supplies) or do you cook just enough to get by? If you give us more info we can tailor our comments accordingly. That said I will offer up my suggestions as well. (Sorry for the length) Essentials: * Crock pot. - Get one. Seriously. MarkerBear made an excellent point about the amazing feeling of coming home to a warm meal. Plus you will almost always have left overs. If you are cooking for 1 or two a 4 quart crock pot should be enough, any more you might want to upgrade to a 6. * Two frying pans of different sizes - 8\" and 10\" are the most common, though you may want to shoot for a 12\" in case of company/large items. * 2-3 sauce pots. - small medium and large, preferably with lids. If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each. If you have non-stick pots make sure they are wooden or that heavy rubber. * 4 place settings - plates, cups, bowls, utensils. You don't want to have to wash dishes every day. * Pairing knife and a larger knife - These are my all time favorite pairing knives (http://www.amazon.com/Rada-Cutlery-Regular-Paring-Aluminum/dp/B000FZXB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378920414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rada+paring+knife) * Cutting board Like others have said, get your salt and pepper, but then buy spices as you need them. You will learn which to buy in bulk as time goes on. Also buy oil, vinegar, flour, and sugar and keep on hand always. Nice to have: * Toaster Oven - These are great for a fast meal as they don't take so long to heat. * Extra place settings = not having to run the dishwasher as often/wash them by hand so soon * A variety of cooking utensils - same reason as above * Casserole pan * Drying mat - especially in the case of no dishwasher * Full knife set - most people list a chef's knife as essential, I didn't have one in college, and I survived without it, but they are nice to have. * Cast iron is amazing, but I wouldn't call it a \"college student\" requirement. * I also like to keep pasta and sauce, garlic, onions, and potatoes on hand. A great idea, like many have said, is to make extra food and freeze it. I also like to chop onions and potatoes and freeze them as well so prep time in cooking is faster. *Edit: Tried to fix formatting, ended up making it worse.

How comfortable are you with cooking? Do you enjoy cooking (if you do you will want more kitchen supplies) or do you cook just enough to get by? If you give us more info we can tailor our comments accordingly. That said I will offer up my suggestions as well. (Sorry for the length) Essentials: * Crock pot. - Get one. Seriously. MarkerBear made an excellent point about the amazing feeling of coming home to a warm meal. Plus you will almost always have left overs. If you are cooking for 1 or two a 4 quart crock pot should be enough, any more you might want to upgrade to a 6. * Two frying pans of different sizes - 8\" and 10\" are the most common, though you may want to shoot for a 12\" in case of company/large items. * 2-3 sauce pots. - small medium and large, preferably with lids. If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each. If you have non-stick pots make sure they are wooden or that heavy rubber. * 4 place settings - plates, cups, bowls, utensils. You don't want to have to wash dishes every day. * Pairing knife and a larger knife - These are my all time favorite pairing knives (http://www.amazon.com/Rada-Cutlery-Regular-Paring-Aluminum/dp/B000FZXB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378920414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rada+paring+knife) * Cutting board Like others have said, get your salt and pepper, but then buy spices as you need them. You will learn which to buy in bulk as time goes on. Also buy oil, vinegar, flour, and sugar and keep on hand always. Nice to have: * Toaster Oven - These are great for a fast meal as they don't take so long to heat. * Extra place settings = not having to run the dishwasher as often/wash them by hand so soon * A variety of cooking utensils - same reason as above * Casserole pan * Drying mat - especially in the case of no dishwasher * Full knife set - most people list a chef's knife as essential, I didn't have one in college, and I survived without it, but they are nice to have. * Cast iron is amazing, but I wouldn't call it a \"college student\" requirement. * I also like to keep pasta and sauce, garlic, onions, and potatoes on hand. A great idea, like many have said, is to make extra food and freeze it. I also like to chop onions and potatoes and freeze them as well so prep time in cooking is faster. *Edit: Tried to fix formatting, ended up making it worse.

{"text":"I've worked as a line cook for the past two summers, and have been going to university the rest of the time. To answer your question, I'd say you'd learn a huge deal working on line. I learned time management and optimization skills that are transferable from restaurant kitchens to chemistry labs. Plus, you'll also pick up fundamentals of food prep and safety, knife skills and care, etc. to say the least. So yes, it has certainly helped me and I'd say it would you too. In terms of actually getting a job with that chunk of time, it really depends on the season you apply in (if the restaurant has seasonal spikes in business) and the quality of that restaurant. Most likely you'll have to either spend a chunk of time in the dish pit or at the bottom of the line before really getting the skills you're looking for. I worked my way up from the dish pit and was offered a spot on the second highest station on line in two summers, so it can certainly be done. My advice, apply everywhere you can ASAP. Chances are someone will want to pick you and have you trained up for the summer rush. **TL;DR:** Yes, it's worth it. Apply everywhere and grab any chance you can to start from the bottom.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

To answer your question, I'd say you'd learn a huge deal working on line. I learned time management and optimization skills that are transferable from restaurant kitchens to chemistry labs. Plus, you'll also pick up fundamentals of food prep and safety, knife skills and care, etc. to say the least. So yes, it has certainly helped me and I'd say it would you too. In terms of actually getting a job with that chunk of time, it really depends on the season you apply in (if the restaurant has seasonal spikes in business) and the quality of that restaurant. Most likely you'll have to either spend a chunk of time in the dish pit or at the bottom of the line before really getting the skills you're looking for. I worked my way up from the dish pit and was offered a spot on the second highest station on line in two summers, so it can certainly be done. My advice, apply everywhere you can ASAP.

{"text":"As it happened, I was completely mistaken about where this dough came from (I dug the bag out of the trash to double check). It was from a small grocery store (Stew's) and was absolutely the worst pre-made dough I'd ever bought. It was just ... tasteless. It probably *would* have been better if it came from the deli (they have a pizza parlor attached, and I've always liked their pizza), and even the dough I get at the Pepperidge Farm outlet is better and tastier. I'm probably going to end up making my own dough, but it just seems so ... messy. And I consider myself 'pastry-challenged'.

{"text":"That's a very easy fix - mix the oil/herbs/garlic, season it, basically everything except the vinegar. Then add the vinegar to taste. It's actually the way we do it at the restaurant I work at. We make a big batch of all the herbs, garlic and oil, season it, and then very finely dice some red onion and marinate it in red wine vinegar (to cover). When someone wants a side of chimichurri, we spoon some of the herb/oil mix into a bowl, and then add some of the onion/vinegar to taste.

{"text":"####Whole fish - Steamed in a banana leaf (or tinfoil) As promised to lacewingfly: *This is my favourite method of cooking a whole fish. I generally use snapper, but any white fish will work, it just needs to be a *reasonably* flat fish. The banana leaf can of course be substituted for tinfoil, but the flavour released from the leaf makes it worth it. The seasonings I am using here are for a ginger and garlic taste, but really you could use any asian seasonings (I've done this with thai green curry paste very successfully).* *This recipe is best cooked on a bbq (grill), but absolutely still delicious if cooked in the oven, so don't worry if you can only do indoor cooking, it'll still rock.* *As usual, all of my quantities are approximate. I eyeball ingredients and add more or less of certain things to my own personal taste, so they are a rough estimate. It seems like there are a lot of steps below, but they're all easy I promise.* OK here we go: ***What You'll need:*** * Whole snapper or similar, scaled, gutted, cleaned, spines removed. Your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask them nicely (if you do this yourself be very careful with the spines on a snapper, they are SHARP AS FUCK!) * Stalk of lemongrass * Spring onions (some for cooking, some for garnish) * Fresh garlic * Fresh ginger (I often advocate jars of minced garlic and ginger, but here fresher is better) * Light soy sauce * Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce, should be easily available) * Mild Long green chilli (we don't want this to be too hot as it will over power the fish) * Juice of 1 lime * Some thai fish sauce * Some finely ground black pepper * A banana leaf (or two small ones, or a pandan leaf, or tinfoil if all else fails) ***What you need to do:*** 1. Start heating up your grill, bbq, or oven 1. Take your banana leaves and soak them in warm water to soften them up a bit and make them a bit more pliable. 1. Peel a thumb sized piece of ginger and slice as thin as humanly possible 1. Peel three cloves of garlic and do the same 1. Take the lemongrass stalk, peel off the outer leaves slice the white part of the stalk, again as thin as you possibly can, do the same with the chilli (use as much or as little as you prefer) 1. Chop two of your spring onions and slice them on the diagonal (these don't need to be too finely sliced) 1. Put all of this in a pestle and mortar and give it a bit of a bash! We aren't trying to make a paste here but a bit of a bruising to release the flavours of the woody ingredients like lemongrass and ginger. 1. Combine (approx) 1tbsp Kecap Manis, 1tbsp light soy sauce, 1/4 tsp fine ground pepper, 1tsp fish sauce, juice of half the lime. Now check the balance! Is it too salty? Add some more lime juice. Is it too sour? Add some more Kecap manis. lacking salt? Add some fish sauce. Balance it out and get it right, trust your palate. (as an aside I tend to keep this one a *little* on the salty side, but that's just my taste.) 1. Once you're happy with the balance of the seasoning sauce, add your ingredients that you have sitting in the pestle and mortar. 1. Give it a mix. Doesn't it smell awesome? It smells like holidays! 1. Grab your fish, and a sharp knife. Slash the fish right down to bone in a few places, both sides of the fish. 1. Put it on a plate and get that delicious sauce all over it! In the slashes you made, in the cavity, on the skin, everywhere! Reserve a little bit of the solids from the sauce. 1. I'm going to have to be a little vague with wrapping instruction I'm afaid, as it depends on the size and shape of your leaves and your fish. Take your Banana leaf and lay it out flat. You are going to want a double layer of banana leaf if you are going to cook over fire or direct heat. Place the fish onto it and pour the remaining sauce over it. 1. Now you need to wrap it. Do it whatever way you can. Use soaked bamboo skewers or soaked twine to secure it all tight (I personally find skewers the best method, thread them through like you are sewing) 1. Lower the heat on your grill, you don't want to burn the leaf badly. It can stand up to some heat but not a high grill. 1. Place the package on the heat and leave it alone. If your bbq has hood, close it. 1. Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. Use your judgement. For a fish big enough to feed two people I reckon it takes about 15 mins over a medium low heat. I'll have to leave this step up to you. 1. While the fish is cooking take two spring onions and slice them paper thin on the diagonal, or cut into matchsticks, these are your garnish (or you could use some coriander leaves if you like it) 1. Presentation time: use a scissors to cut the parcel open *at the table*. OMFG when your guests get that smell bursting out when you open the parcel they are likely to foodgasm. Sprinkle in the chopped spring onions. I usually serve this just with small bowls of good basmati rice sitting on plates, and some stir fried asian greens (bok choi, kai lan, choi sum, whatever) and let people help themselves to fish. I prefer this method of serving, it's a bit more social. 1. Drink lots of ice cold beer. 1. Eat lemon or mango sorbet for dessert. 1. Have fun! I'm always open to comments and constructive criticism, so feel free to tell me what you think. I think this could be greatly improved if served with coconut rice. Has anybody got any tried and tested recipes for coconut rice?","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

I generally use snapper, but any white fish will work, it just needs to be a *reasonably* flat fish. The banana leaf can of course be substituted for tinfoil, but the flavour released from the leaf makes it worth it. The seasonings I am using here are for a ginger and garlic taste, but really you could use any asian seasonings (I've done this with thai green curry paste very successfully).* *This recipe is best cooked on a bbq (grill), but absolutely still delicious if cooked in the oven, so don't worry if you can only do indoor cooking, it'll still rock.* *As usual, all of my quantities are approximate. I eyeball ingredients and add more or less of certain things to my own personal taste, so they are a rough estimate. It seems like there are a lot of steps below, but they're all easy I promise.* OK here we go: ***What You'll need:*** * Whole snapper or similar, scaled, gutted, cleaned, spines removed. Your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask them nicely (if you do this yourself be very careful with the spines on a snapper, they are SHARP AS FUCK!) * Stalk of lemongrass * Spring onions (some for cooking, some for garnish) * Fresh garlic * Fresh ginger (I often advocate jars of minced garlic and ginger, but here fresher is better) * Light soy sauce * Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce, should be easily available) * Mild Long green chilli (we don't want this to be too hot as it will over power the fish) * Juice of 1 lime * Some thai fish sauce * Some finely ground black pepper * A banana leaf (or two small ones, or a pandan leaf, or tinfoil if all else fails) ***What you need to do:*** 1. Start heating up your grill, bbq, or oven 1. Take your banana leaves and soak them in warm water to soften them up a bit and make them a bit more pliable. 1. Peel a thumb sized piece of ginger and slice as thin as humanly possible 1. Peel three cloves of garlic and do the same 1. Take the lemongrass stalk, peel off the outer leaves slice the white part of the stalk, again as thin as you possibly can, do the same with the chilli (use as much or as little as you prefer) 1. Chop two of your spring onions and slice them on the diagonal (these don't need to be too finely sliced) 1. Put all of this in a pestle and mortar and give it a bit of a bash! We aren't trying to make a paste here but a bit of a bruising to release the flavours of the woody ingredients like lemongrass and ginger. 1. Combine (approx) 1tbsp Kecap Manis, 1tbsp light soy sauce, 1/4 tsp fine ground pepper, 1tsp fish sauce, juice of half the lime. Now check the balance! Is it too salty? Add some more lime juice. Is it too sour? Add some more Kecap manis. lacking salt? Add some fish sauce. Balance it out and get it right, trust your palate. (as an aside I tend to keep this one a *little* on the salty side, but that's just my taste.) 1. Once you're happy with the balance of the seasoning sauce, add your ingredients that you have sitting in the pestle and mortar. 1. Give it a mix. Doesn't it smell awesome? It smells like holidays! 1. Grab your fish, and a sharp knife. Slash the fish right down to bone in a few places, both sides of the fish. 1. Put it on a plate and get that delicious sauce all over it! In the slashes you made, in the cavity, on the skin, everywhere! Reserve a little bit of the solids from the sauce. 1. I'm going to have to be a little vague with wrapping instruction I'm afaid, as it depends on the size and shape of your leaves and your fish. Take your Banana leaf and lay it out flat. You are going to want a double layer of banana leaf if you are going to cook over fire or direct heat. Place the fish onto it and pour the remaining sauce over it. 1. Now you need to wrap it. Do it whatever way you can. Use soaked bamboo skewers or soaked twine to secure it all tight (I personally find skewers the best method, thread them through like you are sewing) 1. Lower the heat on your grill, you don't want to burn the leaf badly. It can stand up to some heat but not a high grill. 1. Place the package on the heat and leave it alone. If your bbq has hood, close it. 1. Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. Use your judgement. For a fish big enough to feed two people I reckon it takes about 15 mins over a medium low heat. I'll have to leave this step up to you. 1. While the fish is cooking take two spring onions and slice them paper thin on the diagonal, or cut into matchsticks, these are your garnish (or you could use some coriander leaves if you like it) 1. Presentation time: use a scissors to cut the parcel open *at the table*. OMFG when your guests get that smell bursting out when you open the parcel they are likely to foodgasm. Sprinkle in the chopped spring onions. I usually serve this just with small bowls of good basmati rice sitting on plates, and some stir fried asian greens (bok choi, kai lan, choi sum, whatever) and let people help themselves to fish. I prefer this method of serving, it's a bit more social. 1. Drink lots of ice cold beer. 1. Eat lemon or mango sorbet for dessert. 1. Have fun! I'm always open to comments and constructive criticism, so feel free to tell me what you think. I think this could be greatly improved if served with coconut rice. Has anybody got any tried and tested recipes for coconut rice?\n'''","response":"DISH: fish, snapper, thai green curry paste, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, spring onions, chilli, lime, Kecap Manis, light soy sauce, fish sauce, black pepper, banana leaf\nEQUIPMENT: grill, bbq, oven, pestle and mortar, sharp knife, plate, bamboo skewers, twine, scissors\nINGREDIENT: ginger, garlic, lemongrass, spring onions, chilli, lime, Kecap Manis, light soy sauce, fish sauce, black pepper, banana leaf, snapper, thai green curry paste, coconut rice"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"I started by making my moms comfort food, which probably all came off the back of the box or a fundraising church recipe book. Then around 25 I worked in a kitchen as a dishwasher over a summer and quickly worked my way up to Assistan Baker/Pantry Chef. So the Chef/Sou/Fry/Saut\u00e9/Line cooks were showing me all sorts of stuff while I baked and prepared the salad dressings/sauces and breaded the coconut shrimps and stuff like that. That summer I also went home everyday and watched food network for like 4 hours straight haha. After that I just started looking up recipes and trying to replicate them. Now it\u2019s a mix of Pinterest, YouTube, asking friends,and just winging it. I buy my Asian ingredients at their respective grocer. I live in a major metro so they can be specific Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese instead of one place selling under the umbrella of Asia. Then we also have plenty of Mexican grocers and just a couple Indian ones and Russian. I\u2019m not a master chef or anything, but I do enjoy learning and cooking. My friends are normally impressed with my food, but it would never make it past a real chef. My husband actually cooks a lot better than me because he is very meticulous about the recipes and details and I\u2019m \u201ca little of this a little of that\u201d hahaha except when I am

That summer I also went home everyday and watched food network for like 4 hours straight haha. After that I just started looking up recipes and trying to replicate them. Now it\u2019s a mix of Pinterest, YouTube, asking friends,and just winging it. I buy my Asian ingredients at their respective grocer. I live in a major metro so they can be specific Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese instead of one place selling under the umbrella of Asia. Then we also have plenty of Mexican grocers and just a couple Indian ones and Russian. I\u2019m not a master chef or anything, but I do enjoy learning and cooking. My friends are normally impressed with my food, but it would never make it past a real chef. My husband actually cooks a lot better than me because he is very meticulous about the recipes and details and I\u2019m \u201ca little of this a little of that\u201d hahaha except when I am baking.\n'''","response":"DISH: comfort food, salad dressings, sauces, breaded coconut shrimps\nEQUIPMENT: kitchen\nINGREDIENT: Asian ingredients, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Mexican, Indian, Russian"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

Choose something that catches your eye an start cooking (though sometimes sourcing ingredients are their own fun challenge). Serious eats' food lab also has a bunch of long, multi step recipes that come out pretty good. Vegan Ramen, Meatloaf, Barbacoa. Baking recipes are also fun to expand into. I picked up the momofuku milk bar cookbook and there's a lot of multi-step recipes that have lots of little components you assemble.

{"text":"Thank you for the advice :) Yes, unfortunately I live in an area where the cost of living is very high (San Diego, CA) and I don't even think I have a local butcher shop. $30 would not get me very far at all haha I do love pastas! Do you have any suggestions on making the alfredo/marinara sauces? I think part of why I'm spending so much per week is because I started with *nothing*.

{"text":"1) Although lengthy, seasoning with flaxseed oil is a mainly hands-off undertaking. We highly recommend the treatment: 1. Warm an unseasoned pan (either new or stripped of seasoning*) for 15 minutes in a 200-degree oven to open its pores. 2. Remove the pan from the oven. Place 1 tablespoon flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove excess oil. 3. Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour. Turn off the oven; cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours. 4.

We highly recommend the treatment: 1. Warm an unseasoned pan (either new or stripped of seasoning*) for 15 minutes in a 200-degree oven to open its pores. 2. Remove the pan from the oven. Place 1 tablespoon flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove excess oil. 3. Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour. Turn off the oven; cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours. 4. Repeat the process five more times, or until the pan develops a dark, semi-matte surface. *To strip a cast-iron pan of seasoning, spray it with oven cleaner, wait 30 minutes, wash with soapy water, and thoroughly wipe with paper towels.

{"text":"I personally love to pan fry, so much easier to control how well done it\u2019s cooked to your personal preference. Salmon with skin on is amazing! Drizzle some olive oil in the pan and season the salmon with some salt on both sides. Place the salmon skin down on low-medium heat for a couple of minutes and add a little butter (less or longer depending on how you like it done). Flip over and do the same. Don\u2019t feel pressured to have salmon rarer if you don\u2019t enjoy it. I personally enjoy salmon with a crisp skin but still tender/rawish in the middle. But at the end of the day it\u2019s like steak - everyone has different preferences on how they like it done. Broccoli, asparagus, &amp; potatoes goes lovely with salmon.

Don\u2019t feel pressured to have salmon rarer if you don\u2019t enjoy it. I personally enjoy salmon with a crisp skin but still tender/rawish in the middle. But at the end of the day it\u2019s like steak - everyone has different preferences on how they like it done. Broccoli, asparagus, &amp; potatoes goes lovely with salmon. I also love making a creamy white wine garlic sauce with mine. :)\n'''","response":"DISH: salmon, broccoli, asparagus, potatoes\nEQUIPMENT: pan, olive oil, butter\nINGREDIENT: salt, white wine, garlic"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"Retarded? Firstly, and don't take this the wrong way, but shut the fuck up. This is an amazing thing to share with someone, and that is something that only you and her had, which is something truly wonderful. I'm sorry for your loss, and I know it's still too soon to feel any sense of real hope, but just know, a lot of people have been in similar situations, and they're doing great now, it will get better, I promise. My point is, don't say that what you're thinking is stupid, ever, (unless it's something that is obviously stupid, ever seen that guy who slams the milk jugs on the ground in the supermarket and breaks his jaw? That's fucking retarded). What you share with someone will last forever, even if they aren't physically here anymore, they will forever live on in that sense, even when you can move on (you will, trust me) and even after you die yourself. I don't want you to feel hopeless, or talking down to yourself, it will all get better, just know that you shared some very special moments with a very special someone, and that others care about you, even random internet dickheads like myself, and that is what will help you, be you. I'm sorry for rambling.. It probably didn't even make much sense..I just want you to not feel alone and not be so hard on yourself, even if it was just a somewhat joking use of the word \"retarded\". I've just been in this situation.. I know how it feels, I know the pain, I know the sense of hopelessness, the sense of loneliness, emptiness, and lack of motivation. PM me if you ever just need someone to talk to, I'll be glad to talk. It gets better, I promise.

Firstly, and don't take this the wrong way, but shut the fuck up. This is an amazing thing to share with someone, and that is something that only you and her had, which is something truly wonderful. I'm sorry for your loss, and I know it's still too soon to feel any sense of real hope, but just know, a lot of people have been in similar situations, and they're doing great now, it will get better, I promise. My point is, don't say that what you're thinking is stupid, ever, (unless it's something that is obviously stupid, ever seen that guy who slams the milk jugs on the ground in the supermarket and breaks his jaw? That's fucking retarded). What you share with someone will last forever, even if they aren't physically here anymore, they will forever live on in that sense, even when you can move on (you will, trust me) and even after you die yourself. I don't want you to feel hopeless, or talking down to yourself, it will all get better, just know that you shared some very special moments with a very special someone, and that others care about you, even random internet dickheads like myself, and that is what will help you, be you. I'm sorry for rambling.. It probably didn't even make much sense..I just want you to not feel alone and not be so hard on yourself, even if it was just a somewhat joking use of the word \"retarded\". I've just been in this situation.. I know how it feels, I know the pain, I know the sense of hopelessness, the sense of loneliness, emptiness, and lack of motivation. PM me if you ever just need someone to talk to, I'll be glad to talk. It gets better, I promise. Have a good one, friend.\n'''","response":"DISH: \nEQUIPMENT: \nINGREDIENT:"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"It'll be good, though tilapia is a very lightly flavored fish, so you'd want to go a bit easy on the peppers to keep it balanced. I often make an avocado toast fish sandwich with tilapia. Lemon or lime juice and dill go very nicely with both the fish and the avocado. If you have garlic, a dill garlic sauce is also very versatile. My recommendation would be to butter and toast both slices of bread, put the avocado mix on the bottom slice, then the tilapia, drizzle a bit of lemon juice on top of the fish, sprinkle with dill and a pinch of salt and pepper, and add the top slice. That way you get the flavor of the avocado and peppers, but it won't overpower the seasoned fish or make the whole sandwich too \"mushy\" due to excessive avocado.

I often make an avocado toast fish sandwich with tilapia. Lemon or lime juice and dill go very nicely with both the fish and the avocado. If you have garlic, a dill garlic sauce is also very versatile. My recommendation would be to butter and toast both slices of bread, put the avocado mix on the bottom slice, then the tilapia, drizzle a bit of lemon juice on top of the fish, sprinkle with dill and a pinch of salt and pepper, and add the top slice. That way you get the flavor of the avocado and peppers, but it won't overpower the seasoned fish or make the whole sandwich too \"mushy\" due to excessive avocado. What do you have aside from tilapia, avocado, peppers, and bread?\n'''","response":"DISH: tilapia, avocado toast fish sandwich\nEQUIPMENT: \nINGREDIENT: peppers, lemon, lime juice, dill, garlic, butter, bread, salt, pepper"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"Burritos are really easy. You can buy the wrappers pretty cheap - when you get more adventurous, they're really easy to make by hand as well. The filling we like is: * 1 T cooking oil * half dozen fresh roma tomatoes, chopped * 3 to 6 serrano chilies, diced - or even more if like us you live on the east coast where the available fresh chilies are so mild you can barely taste them. * 1 to 2 tsp minced garlic (or 1 to 2 cloves of fresh garlic put through a garlic press). The minced garlic in the grocery store is generally super-mild, I get better, stronger garlic either at Costco or from an ethnic grocery (pre-minced stuff in jars). * large onion, chopped coarsely * Bell pepper, chopped coarsely * 1 can of black beans, DRAINED * 1 tsp ground cumin * 2 tsp chili powder * shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco - or just buy some pre-shredded Kraft Mexican Mix * sour cream * cilantro, chopped Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet. Dump in the onions and SERRANO peppers and garlic, and stir the spice in with them. Cook over med to med high heat, stirring pretty constantly, until the onions are starting to soften - the edges will start to look translucent, but the centers will still be white. Dump in the BELL pepper and stir fry a couple more minutes. Now add the tomatoes. Stir fry a couple of minutes. Dump in the (drained) beans. Stir well and let cook down so the moisture cooks off. Just stir once in awhile to keep it from sticking/burning. Meanwhile, take 2 burrito wrappers per person, wrap in foil, place on the top rack of the oven, and turn the oven on to about 400F. They will be heated through in 5 mins or so. If your oven is one of the dumb ovens that turns the top element on while preheating, place the wrappers on the BOTTOM rack. Too close to the broiler and they'll turn hard and won't wrap. They make fairly tasty dipping-chips though. When the tomatoes are done, turn off the burner, take a wrapper, slap a spoonful of the above filling in the center. Top with cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro. Fold the bottom edge a couple inches up over the filling. Put a dab of sour cream on the flap. Fold the left edge over and put a dab of sour cream along that flap. Fold the final edge over top of that. The sour cream will make the burrito wrapper stick closed. Chow down. I know, it's meatless. If you must have meat, you can add some shredded or finely sliced cooked beef or some cooked chicken at the end with the beans. Grilled or blackened chicken is pretty tasty in a burrito. It's just easier to make it without, unless and until you get the whole basic cooking thing down.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

You can buy the wrappers pretty cheap - when you get more adventurous, they're really easy to make by hand as well. The filling we like is: * 1 T cooking oil * half dozen fresh roma tomatoes, chopped * 3 to 6 serrano chilies, diced - or even more if like us you live on the east coast where the available fresh chilies are so mild you can barely taste them. * 1 to 2 tsp minced garlic (or 1 to 2 cloves of fresh garlic put through a garlic press). The minced garlic in the grocery store is generally super-mild, I get better, stronger garlic either at Costco or from an ethnic grocery (pre-minced stuff in jars). * large onion, chopped coarsely * Bell pepper, chopped coarsely * 1 can of black beans, DRAINED * 1 tsp ground cumin * 2 tsp chili powder * shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco - or just buy some pre-shredded Kraft Mexican Mix * sour cream * cilantro, chopped Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet. Dump in the onions and SERRANO peppers and garlic, and stir the spice in with them. Cook over med to med high heat, stirring pretty constantly, until the onions are starting to soften - the edges will start to look translucent, but the centers will still be white. Dump in the BELL pepper and stir fry a couple more minutes. Now add the tomatoes. Stir fry a couple of minutes. Dump in the (drained) beans. Stir well and let cook down so the moisture cooks off. Just stir once in awhile to keep it from sticking/burning. Meanwhile, take 2 burrito wrappers per person, wrap in foil, place on the top rack of the oven, and turn the oven on to about 400F. They will be heated through in 5 mins or so. If your oven is one of the dumb ovens that turns the top element on while preheating, place the wrappers on the BOTTOM rack. Too close to the broiler and they'll turn hard and won't wrap. They make fairly tasty dipping-chips though. When the tomatoes are done, turn off the burner, take a wrapper, slap a spoonful of the above filling in the center. Top with cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro. Fold the bottom edge a couple inches up over the filling. Put a dab of sour cream on the flap. Fold the left edge over and put a dab of sour cream along that flap. Fold the final edge over top of that. The sour cream will make the burrito wrapper stick closed. Chow down. I know, it's meatless. If you must have meat, you can add some shredded or finely sliced cooked beef or some cooked chicken at the end with the beans. Grilled or blackened chicken is pretty tasty in a burrito. It's just easier to make it without, unless and until you get the whole basic cooking thing down.\n'''","response":"DISH: burritos\nEQUIPMENT: skillet, foil, oven\nINGREDIENT: cooking oil, roma tomatoes, serrano chilies, minced garlic, onion, bell pepper, black beans, ground cumin, chili powder, shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco, sour cream, cilantro, burrito wrappers, cheese, beef, chicken"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"So I am going to go off a tangent here and suggest make a dessert. Sugar always uplifts your mood and makes you feel happy. If you don't like overly sweet dessert, you might like this **chocolate truffle ** recipe. It can be kept up to 2 weeks and make a pretty impressive gift for friends and family. *1 block of cream cheese * 2 cups of dark chocolate (semi-sweet chocolate chip can work ) *1 tablespoon of cream/milk (optional) * 2 cups of powder sugar, you can go up to 3 cups but I usually make mine with 1 and 2/3 cup. * any of combination of your favourite flavours. I have two that I like to use: fuzzy fun time (tonka bean, vanilla extract and honeysuckle syrup) and dirty chai (roasted Assam tea, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger powder and a dash of soy sauce) * cocoa powder/coconut/ nut for rolling the truffle in Make sure everything at room temperature before you start. Beat the cream cheese with the powder sugar and your flavouring spices of choice until nice and fluffy (2 mins). Melt the chocolate in microwave/over bain-marie in a 20 s increment. Add the cream to make it easier to stir the chocolate if needed to. Pour the chocolate over the cream. stir until combined with a spatula. Put it in the fridge for up to 2 hours for it to chill and easier to shape l into a ball. Roll the ball into the cocoa powder/coconut/etc. If you were too lazy like me, you can just eat it with a spoon and skip the next step.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

I have two that I like to use: fuzzy fun time (tonka bean, vanilla extract and honeysuckle syrup) and dirty chai (roasted Assam tea, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger powder and a dash of soy sauce) * cocoa powder/coconut/ nut for rolling the truffle in Make sure everything at room temperature before you start. Beat the cream cheese with the powder sugar and your flavouring spices of choice until nice and fluffy (2 mins). Melt the chocolate in microwave/over bain-marie in a 20 s increment. Add the cream to make it easier to stir the chocolate if needed to. Pour the chocolate over the cream. stir until combined with a spatula. Put it in the fridge for up to 2 hours for it to chill and easier to shape l into a ball. Roll the ball into the cocoa powder/coconut/etc. If you were too lazy like me, you can just eat it with a spoon and skip the next step.\n'''","response":"DISH: chocolate truffle\nEQUIPMENT: microwave, bain-marie, fridge\nINGREDIENT: cream cheese, dark chocolate, cream/milk, powder sugar, tonka bean, vanilla extract, honeysuckle syrup, roasted Assam tea, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger powder, soy sauce, cocoa powder, coconut, nut"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"This is slightly off-topic and soap-boxy, but what the heck. I like to take the designation \"side\" and throw it out. I think it makes people think that something is \"just a side,\" so it doesn't require much attention. If you make a potato, do a good job. Same thing with white rice. Do simple things well and you'll get a lot of mileage out of them. If you cook your rice well, with attention to detail, you can serve it with literally every meal, every day, and people will be happy with it. I eat out a lot - people have me over. I guess I'm amusing and a good guest. And I'm legitimately grateful for it, and I always eat what's served and compliment it in a sincere way - you can always find something good to say honestly. But how many times do I see some well meaning person who decides to \"take it to the next level,\" and takes something rather nice and humble and adds some interesting sounding ingredients to it just because they seem \"cool,\" and it's just an awful silly mess. In all the excitement over the interesting new ingredients, they forget to do the basics, and it ruins the whole thing.

I like to take the designation \"side\" and throw it out. I think it makes people think that something is \"just a side,\" so it doesn't require much attention. If you make a potato, do a good job. Same thing with white rice. Do simple things well and you'll get a lot of mileage out of them. If you cook your rice well, with attention to detail, you can serve it with literally every meal, every day, and people will be happy with it. I eat out a lot - people have me over. I guess I'm amusing and a good guest. And I'm legitimately grateful for it, and I always eat what's served and compliment it in a sincere way - you can always find something good to say honestly. But how many times do I see some well meaning person who decides to \"take it to the next level,\" and takes something rather nice and humble and adds some interesting sounding ingredients to it just because they seem \"cool,\" and it's just an awful silly mess. In all the excitement over the interesting new ingredients, they forget to do the basics, and it ruins the whole thing. There are more serious problems in the world, obviously, but, well, sometimes it's nice to have a voice.

I like brisket, bacon, or sausage for the meat, barley, and a bit of cheese tucked into jalapenos... but most people go for rice and ground beef in bell peppers. Frittata/tortilla.

{"text":"I've been using this excellent recipe for a few years now. The only time it failed me was when I made the coffee flavor. The corrected method is to bring the milk &amp; cream to a simmer, add the ground coffee, then steep off heat for 5 minutes. Strain that through cheesecloth, then proceed to make your ice cream. If you make the base, then try to strain out the grounds you will be squeezing cheesecloth for a good hour because of how thick the liquid becomes.

Light grill and regulate temperature to 250 degrees. Add cherry and pecan wood for smoking. Once the smoke turns from white to light blue and is not billowing white, it is ready for the chili. 2. In the meantime, chop celery and onion until you have 3 cups of each. Finely chop the jalapeno and the poblano peppers. 3. Using an enameled dutch oven, saute in 1 tbsp vegetable oil until translucent. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add to the mixture Saute this mixture for about a minute, then make a hole in the middle of the vegetables for the spices. This will give them some space to bloom. After spices have cooked in the oil for a few minutes, mix everything together and let cook for another minute. Add 1 cup of red wine and let this simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beef stock, beer, bloody mary mix, and pinto beans (optional). You can test for salt after this simmers for a few minutes. Bring this mixture to a slight boil, then let simmer. 4. Put the pot of chili on the grill indirect with an air gap under it. I rolled up 3 pieces of foil and set them under the pot so there was an air gap and it did not sit directly on the plate setter/heat deflector. This will prevent it from getting too hot and boiling over and the chili should have a slight simmer for the duration of the cook. 5. Prepare the ground beef by hand by rolling into an oval and dusting with salt and pepper. Place a rack over the chili, then the meat on top of the rack so it drips into the chili as it smokes. When the meat reaches 165 degrees internal temperature, the meat is ready to be broken up and added to the pot.

Light grill and regulate temperature to 250 degrees. Add cherry and pecan wood for smoking. Once the smoke turns from white to light blue and is not billowing white, it is ready for the chili. 2. In the meantime, chop celery and onion until you have 3 cups of each. Finely chop the jalapeno and the poblano peppers. 3. Using an enameled dutch oven, saute in 1 tbsp vegetable oil until translucent. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add to the mixture Saute this mixture for about a minute, then make a hole in the middle of the vegetables for the spices. This will give them some space to bloom. After spices have cooked in the oil for a few minutes, mix everything together and let cook for another minute. Add 1 cup of red wine and let this simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beef stock, beer, bloody mary mix, and pinto beans (optional). You can test for salt after this simmers for a few minutes. Bring this mixture to a slight boil, then let simmer. 4. Put the pot of chili on the grill indirect with an air gap under it. I rolled up 3 pieces of foil and set them under the pot so there was an air gap and it did not sit directly on the plate setter/heat deflector. This will prevent it from getting too hot and boiling over and the chili should have a slight simmer for the duration of the cook. 5. Prepare the ground beef by hand by rolling into an oval and dusting with salt and pepper. Place a rack over the chili, then the meat on top of the rack so it drips into the chili as it smokes. When the meat reaches 165 degrees internal temperature, the meat is ready to be broken up and added to the pot. Simmer for 20 more minutes and then serve hot with corn chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onion.\n'''","response":"DISH: Over The Top Smoked Chili\nEQUIPMENT: enameled dutch oven\nINGREDIENT: celery, jalapenos, red onion, poblano pepper, garlic, red wine, ground beef, tomato sauce, canned diced tomatoes, beef stock, Shiner Bock, Bloody Mary mix, pinto beans, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, Mexican oregano, powdered onion, salt, cherry wood, pecan wood, vegetable oil, salt, pepper, corn chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onion"},"_view_id":"ner_manual"}
