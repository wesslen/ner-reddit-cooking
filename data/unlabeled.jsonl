{"text":"Hello Daniel, How are you thinking schedule wise? Cause with a busy schedule I'm imagining you'd be streaming anywhere from 1-3 days of the week cause it takes a lot of energy to put on a show as well by yourself. Also what everyone else has touched on, content. If you have demands and a list of dishes you want to do each stream (each streaming being 1 dish at a minimal basis), it wouldn't be a bad idea. Cause a 3-4 hour typical stream would require a lot of energy but having an established schedule with a consistent starting time, a 40minute to an hour and a half making simple home ingredient or spiced up refined dishes would be a good start. Depends on your schedule too which I'm sure you more than myself have considered without me telling you :D. Under the 'Creative' category of Twitch, there's a large variety of what people stream (varying from forging metal, carving wood, digital paintings, etc.) and personally for me its just the chill environment that the broadcaster can put on that makes it worth watching, not so much the content priority wise at first. As some have already mentioned, if you are able to be entertaining by yourself for a period of time, the content will only be a bonus added on top. But I think by your statements, the act of sharing your ideas and knowledge to others will be a great way for you to rekindle that enthusiasm, and it will show it to the viewers. I love cooking and I would love to see a variety of dishes ranging technicality wise and also touching on your home roots of cultural palettes. I don't see too many cooking streamers (I use twitch) so this is something I would be down provided the broadcaster (you) can establish that chill learning environment :) it sure as hell not gonna be easy, cause with cooking I imagine you would need some production value which doesn't come cheap. Simple camera or multiple (for angles), some extra lightning (if the room lightning isn't sufficient), a mic, but that's just me with my standards of production value. You can get a lot done with a webcam and its built in mic so don't worry too much on that at first, sorry. Content comes first, then the production value and consistency of the stream. 1 final note is that establishing yourself as a streamer from the get go is gonna be hard at first because its something you have to be consistent with. A good idea is to archive it online like on Youtube and redirect them to your streams. Or even both, or just one. Both platforms have their pros and cons but streaming at the start is going to be tough. If you can get the snowball effect going, all to ya :)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1449183956}}

{"text":"My SO and I have been experimenting for a while with pizza recipes and now I think we have the perfect one. Here's what we found makes an awesome pie: 1. crust. Find a recipe that requires multiple folding and resting cycles (2 or 3). I've tried those recipes that only need an hour to rise and then go right into the oven and it just doesn't allow enough time for flavor to develop. Our usual recipe takes 12 hours total but a lot of that is wait time so it's not so bad 2. sauce. 1 can san marzano tomatoes, salt, pepper, olive oil, basil (optional). just crush it all together. Drain tomatoes first for chunky sauce. Simple and delicious and so easy. 3. cheese. I like a mixture of mozz, parmesean, and asiago. Mozz is a super mild flavor so experiment with mixing some other cheeses with it. 4. some people have also mentioned higher temperature. We use 550 bc it's the highest our oven will go. If your oven doesn't get hot enough (or even if it does) you can broil it for the last 2 minutes of baking to get the cheese to brown slightly which is super yummy Good luck on your pizza endeavor!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1459348925}}

{"text":"The finger test is not a good way to tell when your meat is done. Use an instant-read digital thermometer instead. You do not need to (and should not) bring your meat to room temperature before you cook it. Leaving it on the counter for 30 minutes will not appreciably raise the internal temperature of the meat and will bring the outside of the meat into the danger zone for bacteria growth. How much/when to flip/move your meat is dependent on a number of factors such as patty thickness and your goal for the burger, e.g. maximize browning vs. maximizing amount of medium rare beef. There is no one size fits all answer. Heat distribution in a pan is more a function of the material of a pan as well as time. However, pans with thicker bottoms are able to maintain their temperature better when food is added compared to thin bottomed pans which is useful when cooking burgers.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1530283501}}

I am sure learning to cook to feed yourself, or to accumulate skills has value, but I don't see that keeping anyone's interest for very long. You may stop cooking before you reach proficiency at anything.

{"text":"I'm not trying to pick apart your technique, but artisan pizza has been an obsession of my over the last few years and I think that I can offer some suggestions which may help even further improve your pizza, if you're interested. If nothing else, this may be a brain dump for anyone interested. Rising bread in the oven is a no-no; rising shouldn't happen in environments above 80F and it will likely dry out the outside of the dough at that temp. Slow ferment=flavor. Most people these days actually prefer a slow ferment in the fridge for ~12-24h. I like to then let it sit on the counter for ~3 hours after fridge ferment that before shaping, but some people say only 45m-1h is necessary. Also, you don't need pizza dough to double in size. Most bread bakers actually say it's not about volume increase, but the feel that lets you know when your bread is ready. If you're hand kneading you can knead for 45 minutes, but its pretty easy to overknead with a mixer. I prefer the romantic nature of working with my hands with the dough, so I really can't comment much on automatic kneading. I just took a bread class from some crazy French guy that makes amazing bread, though, and he says he recommends no more than ~10 minutes on the mixer. If you're working with wet dough, this French Fold technique is great (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvdtUR-XTG0) and the secret is to pull it off the counter real quick. Quick sharp movements. I've never had good luck with the broiler. I have a gas stove, though, so my broiler doesnt seem to get as hot. I can get a stone to ~660F without any oven tricks. I like to be at around 730-750 since I prefer a Neapolitan style. Sometimes I'll throw a frozen washcloth on the oven's thermometer to get into the temperature I like to bake at, though you need to remember to take that off when you're done (true story). Google 'Little Black Egg' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtXTMufUMh0) if you are interested in an affordable outdoor pizza oven (this may be a summer project for me) capable of getting into Neapolitan temps. If I could boil down my beginner mistakes, they would be: * Measure ingredients out on a scale. Measuring flour by volume is too inaccurate. * Don't fear wet dough, and don't reach for flour when it is too wet. Trust the hydration ratio when you're starting out. Kneading will transform the gluten into something workable. The more flour you add, the more uniform your dough is going to become. 60% is a good place where it is manageable, yet still rewarding. * Preheat the stone for 1+ hour. Get that sucker hoooooot. Verify temp with an IR thermometer. The hotter you get it , the more open crumb (big flavorful holes) you get because you get better oven spring. * Use sauce and toppings minimally, or deal with your pizza sticking to your peel. * Work fast while preparing the pizza with toppings. I usually have it sauced, topped, and in the oven in about 60s from transferring the naked shaped dough onto the peel. Every 15s I'm shaking the peel to make sure nothing is sticking. Making pizza (Napels style, at least) may be one of the hardest things to do properly in the kitchen. It's quite an art form, and takes quite a bit of practice. The good pizza makers seem to make pizza almost once a week at home. Varsano's site helped me tremendously when I was getting started: http://varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm And I always pick up little things here and there from pizzamaking.com.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1326769916"}}

That helps you save money by knowing you're going to use everything, and it stops you from aimlessly wandering around the mart putting things in your cart.

{"text":"NYT: Cilantro Haters, It\u2019s Not Your Fault By HAROLD McGEE Modern cilantrophobes tend to describe the offending flavor as soapy rather than buggy. I don\u2019t hate cilantro, but it does sometimes remind me of hand lotion. Each of these associations turns out to make good chemical sense. Flavor chemists have found that cilantro aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are modified fragments of fat molecules called aldehydes. The same or similar aldehydes are also found in soaps and lotions and the bug family of insects. Soaps are made by fragmenting fat molecules with strongly alkaline lye or its equivalent, and aldehydes are a byproduct of this process, as they are when oxygen in the air attacks the fats and oils in cosmetics. And many bugs make strong-smelling, aldehyde-rich body fluids to attract or repel other creatures. The published studies of cilantro aroma describe individual aldehydes as having both cilantrolike and soapy qualities. Several flavor chemists told me in e-mail messages that they smell a soapy note in the whole herb as well, but still find its aroma fresh and pleasant. So the cilantro aldehydes are olfactory Jekyll-and-Hydes. Why is it only the evil, soapy side that shows up for cilantrophobes, and not the charming one?","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1394663984"}}

When the slow cooker is done after 4-6 hours on high, shred the chicken into the remaining salsa compote and you have fantastic chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side.

Melt butter in large saucepan on low heat. Whisk in flour, stirring until smooth. Gradually stir/whisk in milk, slowly so you don't get clumps. Heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and is thickened. Remove from heat. Stir in salt, w sauce and cheese, until cheese melts. Add macaroni and mix well. Put in a greased 3 litre casserole. Bake at 375F for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Don't let it sit too long after that or it goes a bit stoggy. Makes 6 servings. .

{"text":"I like my \"oatmeal\" made with \u00bd steel cut oat and \u00bd kasha, aka roasted buckwheat. The difference between steel cut and rolled oats is that the former has texture and flavor and adding buckwheat gives it even more of both. Generally 1 part grain to 4 parts water. I cook for myself and one serving is \u00bc cup grain to 1 cup liquid, but use common sense. For instance, If you're adding a whole banana out of the freezer use less water because there's a lot of liquid in the banana. If you're adding dried blueberries or dried tart cherries use more water cause the dried fruit will absorb water. For sweet oats, I add 1 teaspoon sweetener per serving, usually brown sugar, maple syrup, or honey; usually toss in a teaspoon of cinnamon too. If I'm making savory ~~porridge~~ oatmeal I brown the sausage and saut\u00e9 the onions, garlic, and hot peppers first. I use a double boiler because there is no chance of burning and I don't have to watch it or even stir. Just set a timer for 40 minutes and forget it. I don't have a double boiler so what I mean is I put a good quart of water in a 1.5 qt. pot and put the oats in a covered 3-quart mixing bowl on top of the pot.

{"text":"$430 a month on food is a nice budget for one person, including snacks and so forth - but you need to learn to work with leftovers. Either enjoying them as leftovers or learning to reuse them. Some of my standard meals during the course of a week include a whole roasted chicken (roasted chicken and veg the first night, then sandwiches for lunch, then maybe chicken tacos or chicken enchiladas the next night [with leftovers of that for the next lunch], then make stock from the carcass for using in other meals. I also do a lot of big pots of soup, stew, or chili that can be either eaten on for a couple of days or you can make double or triple batches of some things and then freeze them for later in the week or month (keeps me from getting tired of the same thing over and over). And I have to admit for a fondness for old-fashioned tuna noodle casserole (with homemade mushroom sauce) with frozen veggies in it. It also serves well for a couple of meals at a minimum and some leftovers you can freeze and nuke for later. Being willing to do a few veggie or low meat meals will help keep costs down as well. Make a pot of beans and rice or a veggie stir fry (or one with very little meat added). Breakfast for dinner can be cheap and really delicious, too. Speaking of breakfast, get away from cereal since it's expensive. I love steel cut oats in the winter - they're a little more expensive up front, but a 1/4 cup expands in a cup of water to make a nice serving, and when topped with cut up fruit, it's a good bit of food. Or mix oats with a little cheese and top with a fried or poached egg for a savory version. One thing I do that saves money is wait until chicken breasts go on sale for some ridiculously low price. Then I'll buy a bunch and poach them in water that has a big scoop of taco seasoning in it. Shred them and then freeze them in 2 serving packets. That chicken can be used in enchiladas, tacos, nachos, any type of Mexican dish you want, and it's pre-cooked and ready to go. Avoid prepackaged snacks and things that are in \"single serving\" sizes. They actually wind up costing more per serving. Obviously don't buy in bulk if you don't have a way to freeze/preserve things, but there's a balance between the two. I think on your budget you could have some great meals. Good luck.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1449018865}}

By way of example, I offer quartered artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, capers and sliced scallions as 4 separate topping options, because I make a killer salad with those ingredients and can just store them together after the party for a day or two until I can fit the salad into my regular rotation. Chopped fried bacon is another topping I always offer, because I know that in any given meal, I can put leftovers to good use; the same is true of whole garlic cloves roasted in olive oil. ... and use fresh mushrooms, sliced and sauteed until lightly brown in olive oil or butter as to your taste.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1517020786}}
