{"text":"Lasagna! It's relatively cheap, you can pack it with nutrition and it freezes and re-heats beautifully. My recipe involves *a box of lasagna noodles *a big jar of spaghetti sauce *a little container of chevre (I fucking hate ricotta) *2 eggs *2 cups of shredded zucchini (or carrots, or even turnips, or whatever you want) *some sauteed mushrooms in a bunch of garlic and olive oil *lots of mozzarella and/or provolone Experiment with layers. Enjoy. Quiche is also super easy ... I have never needed to freeze it as it gets eaten so fast, even with only 2 members in my household :) You need like 6 eggs and a cup of milk, a couple handfuls of your favorite cheese (cheddar is my go-to), and a crust (obviously homemade is better, but store-bought is fine!) and asparagus or mushrooms or spinach or kale or whatever you want to put in that bitch, and you bake it for like 40 minutes at about 350 or something... Mollie Katzen has an amazing quiche recipe in either the Enchanted Broccoli Forest or Moosewood cookbook. Those are both incredible cookbooks for healthy (... often buttery, but I'm from Wisconsin so to me that still means healthy), filling, interesting, DELICIOUS meals. Super easy instructions, too. I dig rice and beans too. Like 2 cups of water and a cup of rice (cooked, obviously), and a big can of beans (I fucking hate cooking beans) and a bunch of garlic and onion all sauteed in butter or olive oil with some tamari and maybe some ginger in there, and some carrots (shredded) and after it's all cooked together and delicious throw some cheese and sour cream in there if you're digging the dairy, or some bacon or whatever garnish makes you have mouthgasms.

It's relatively cheap, you can pack it with nutrition and it freezes and re-heats beautifully. My recipe involves *a box of lasagna noodles *a big jar of spaghetti sauce *a little container of chevre (I fucking hate ricotta) *2 eggs *2 cups of shredded zucchini (or carrots, or even turnips, or whatever you want) *some sauteed mushrooms in a bunch of garlic and olive oil *lots of mozzarella and/or provolone Experiment with layers. Enjoy. Quiche is also super easy ... I have never needed to freeze it as it gets eaten so fast, even with only 2 members in my household :) You need like 6 eggs and a cup of milk, a couple handfuls of your favorite cheese (cheddar is my go-to), and a crust (obviously homemade is better, but store-bought is fine!) and asparagus or mushrooms or spinach or kale or whatever you want to put in that bitch, and you bake it for like 40 minutes at about 350 or something... Mollie Katzen has an amazing quiche recipe in either the Enchanted Broccoli Forest or Moosewood cookbook. Those are both incredible cookbooks for healthy (... often buttery, but I'm from Wisconsin so to me that still means healthy), filling, interesting, DELICIOUS meals. Super easy instructions, too. I dig rice and beans too. Like 2 cups of water and a cup of rice (cooked, obviously), and a big can of beans (I fucking hate cooking beans) and a bunch of garlic and onion all sauteed in butter or olive oil with some tamari and maybe some ginger in there, and some carrots (shredded) and after it's all cooked together and delicious throw some cheese and sour cream in there if you're digging the dairy, or some bacon or whatever garnish makes you have mouthgasms. Maybe some scallions or something, that sounds good! I fucking love food.\n'''","response":"DISH: lasagna, quiche\nEQUIPMENT: none\nINGREDIENT: lasagna noodles, spaghetti sauce, chevre, eggs, shredded zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, garlic, olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, quiche, eggs, milk, cheese, crust, asparagus, mushrooms, spinach, kale, rice, water, beans, garlic, onion, butter, olive oil, tamari, ginger, carrots, cheese, sour cream, bacon, scallions"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","_is_binary":false,"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698346290,"_annotator_id":"74311371-2734-49f6-9e34-0f60c56e045f","_session_id":"9e0d9980-fb76-44ec-b58f-3fc66365269f"}

{"text":"No problem. Hope the Pulled pork tastes great! Bonus: Slow Cooker Pulled Pork - 1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin - 1 (12 ounce) can of root beer (*We use \"Barq's\"*) - 1 (18 ounce) bottle of barbecue sauce (*We use \"Bullseye Hickory BBQ Sauce*) -1. Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker and pour the can of root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours (*8 hours for super tender*) or until pork shreds easily with a fork. - 2. After pork has cooked, drain and discard the root beer (*you can save it in a bowl or cup, use it to make the pork super juicy again the second day*) . Shred the pork and place it back in the slow cooker. Pour the barbecue sauce over the pork and stir to combine (*add some of the Rootbeer sauce to kick up the flavour*). Serve immediately or keep warm in slow cooker until ready to serve.

Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker and pour the can of root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours (*8 hours for super tender*) or until pork shreds easily with a fork. - 2. After pork has cooked, drain and discard the root beer (*you can save it in a bowl or cup, use it to make the pork super juicy again the second day*) . Shred the pork and place it back in the slow cooker. Pour the barbecue sauce over the pork and stir to combine (*add some of the Rootbeer sauce to kick up the flavour*). Serve immediately or keep warm in slow cooker until ready to serve.

{"text":"I have a soft spot for fresh bread with butter and heavy sugar coat. Crunchy and so satisfying if u crave sweets. I also loved cucumbers with honey. It tastes kinda like bananas. One of my fav sides is also cucumbers cut into thin slices with some cream 18% or so with sugar and salt. Sometimes if we had some leftover boiled potatoes my grandma would make them into mush, add some onion and salt and fry it forming a big pancake. It was so good and crunchy, best served with cold glass of milk. My fav main dish was something my family called 'makagulo' (dunno where the name came from, prolly just random joke) it was basically all veggies like bell peppers, onions, carrots, celery, and tomatoes cut into pieces and mixed with leftover meats (ham, sausages, hot dogs), then fried for extra flavour and then layered with all of the leftover pasta into lasagna like thingy, splashed with tomatoe paste or ketchup and lots of cheese and baked. Fills u up good and is a great way to use everything from the fridge that may go bad soon.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548815606},"_input_hash":1016407149,"_task_hash":138277953,"tokens":[{"text":"I","start":0,"end":1,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"have","start":2,"end":6,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":7,"end":8,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"soft","start":9,"end":13,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"spot","start":14,"end":18,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":19,"end":22,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"fresh","start":23,"end":28,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"bread","start":29,"end":34,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":35,"end":39,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"butter","start":40,"end":46,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":47,"end":50,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"heavy","start":51,"end":56,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"sugar","start":57,"end":62,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"coat","start":63,"end":67,"id":13,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":67,"end":68,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"Crunchy","start":69,"end":76,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":77,"end":80,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":81,"end":83,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"satisfying","start":84,"end":94,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"if","start":95,"end":97,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"u","start":98,"end":99,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"crave","start":100,"end":105,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"sweets","start":106,"end":112,"id":22,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":112,"end":113,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"I","start":114,"end":115,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"also","start":116,"end":120,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"loved","start":121,"end":126,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"cucumbers","start":127,"end":136,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":137,"end":141,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"honey","start":142,"end":147,"id":29,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":147,"end":148,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"It","start":149,"end":151,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"tastes","start":152,"end":158,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"kinda","start":159,"end":164,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"like","start":165,"end":169,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"bananas","start":170,"end":177,"id":35,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":177,"end":178,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"One","start":179,"end":182,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":183,"end":185,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"my","start":186,"end":188,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"fav","start":189,"end":192,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"sides","start":193,"end":198,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":199,"end":201,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"also","start":202,"end":206,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"cucumbers","start":207,"end":216,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"cut","start":217,"end":220,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":221,"end":225,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"thin","start":226,"end":230,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"slices","start":231,"end":237,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":238,"end":242,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":243,"end":247,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"cream","start":248,"end":253,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"18","start":254,"end":256,"id":52,"ws":false},{"text":"%","start":256,"end":257,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":258,"end":260,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"so","start":261,"end":263,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":264,"end":268,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"sugar","start":269,"end":274,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":275,"end":278,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":"salt","start":279,"end":283,"id":59,"ws":false},{"text":".","start":283,"end":284,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":"Sometimes","start":285,"end":294,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":"if","start":295,"end":297,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":298,"end":300,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"had","start":301,"end":304,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":305,"end":309,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":"leftover","start":310,"end":318,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":"boiled","start":319,"end":325,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"potatoes","start":326,"end":334,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"my","start":335,"end":337,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"grandma","start":338,"end":345,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"would","start":346,"end":351,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"make","start":352,"end":356,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":"them","start":357,"end":361,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"into","start":362,"end":366,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"mush","start":367,"end":371,"id":75,"ws":false},{"text":",","start":371,"end":372,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":"add","start":373,"end":376,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":"some","start":377,"end":381,"id":78,"ws":true},{"text":"onion","start":382,"end":387,"id":79,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":388,"end":391,"id":80,"ws":true},{"text":"salt","start":392,"end":396,"id":81,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":397,"end":400,"id":82,"ws":true},{"text":"fry","start":401,"end":404,"id":83,"ws":true},{"text":"it","start":405,"end":407,"id":84,"ws":true},{"text":"forming","start":408,"end":415,"id":85,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":416,"end":417,"id":86,"ws":true},{"text":"big","start":418,"end":421,"id":87,"ws":true},{"text":"pancake","start

Sometimes if we had some leftover boiled potatoes my grandma would make them into mush, add some onion and salt and fry it forming a big pancake.

{"text":"Here's a pic of the inside. It came from a high end cooking store. I see all clad pans in there and very high priced knives and such. I was told it was upward of $100. I see after some additional research that the issue is with the chemicals in the glaze. I guess I need to call the store and ask. Sur la table sells glazed, although undecorated and says it's OK to cook in. The inside is much rougher than the outside. Just the base.

{"text":"Sorry, I posted from my phone and forgot to update. Ingredients: 2 large white onions, sliced into thin strips 1 tbsp butter 1 quart beef stock 1 tsp each of nutmeg, fresh ground pepper, and seasoned salt ~1 cup of chardonnay ~1/4 loaf French bread ~2 cups shredded mozarella Sautee the onions with the butter and seasoned salt in a (hopefully) stainless steel pot under medium heat until they start to burn a little. Deglaze with the white whine and beef stock. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer. Add the pepper and nutmeg and reduce for about 15 minutes. Ladel the soup into individual bowls and top with slices of the French bread (it doesn't have to be pretty). Make sure the bread soaks up the soup all the way and top with the mozzarella cheese. Broil until the cheese melts and starts to burn a little.

{"text":"There are tons of great macaroni &amp; cheese recipes, but the basic recipe is good to know, because the base of the cheese sauce, your basic white sauce, can be modified to any taste. You basically start by making a roux, which is equal parts butter &amp; flour (you can use oil instead of butter, but the flavor will change). I normally do 4 T butter to 1/4 cup flour. Melt the butter, then add the flour, and cook until it's golden, maybe around 5 minutes (don't skip this step, otherwise the sauce will taste like flour). At this time you can add salt/pepper/dried spices. Once that's incorporated, add milk (I use 2 cups), then cook over medium heat till bubbly. At this point, you can add shredded cheddar or any other type of cheese. I use cheddar with a bit of freshly grated reggiano parmesan. I'd use about 2 cups cheese total for this recipe.

You basically start by making a roux, which is equal parts butter &amp; flour (you can use oil instead of butter, but the flavor will change). I normally do 4 T butter to 1/4 cup flour. Melt the butter, then add the flour, and cook until it's golden, maybe around 5 minutes (don't skip this step, otherwise the sauce will taste like flour). At this time you can add salt/pepper/dried spices. Once that's incorporated, add milk (I use 2 cups), then cook over medium heat till bubbly. At this point, you can add shredded cheddar or any other type of cheese. I use cheddar with a bit of freshly grated reggiano parmesan. I'd use about 2 cups cheese total for this recipe.

{"text":"> Infrared radiation is the best method for delivering high heat to food on a grill. Charcoal grills produce a lot of direct scorching infrared radiation that is converted to heat when it strikes food. Gas and pellet grills produce mostly convection heat. > > Is IR heating better? Dr. Blonder says \"IR energy is delivered faster than convection, but slower than conduction. So it can brown a little more effectively than a conventional grill but not as fast as a hot pan or grill grates. There are fewer hot spots from IR cookers. On the other hand, you can get thermal runaway with IR. If one section of the meat is dark, it absorbs more IR than the lighter sections. It browns, becomes darker still, and eventually burns.\" While it's bad writing style to first make a statement and later question it, I also find the section misleading.

So it can brown a little more effectively than a conventional grill but not as fast as a hot pan or grill grates. There are fewer hot spots from IR cookers. On the other hand, you can get thermal runaway with IR. If one section of the meat is dark, it absorbs more IR than the lighter sections. It browns, becomes darker still, and eventually burns.\" While it's bad writing style to first make a statement and later question it, I also find the section misleading.

{"text":"I kind of loosely based my recipe off a couple I found, and it's different every time. I make mine with some other veggies. I start off by soaking the beans (2 cups) overnight, then rinsing them. Important step! Really improves the digestibility and cooking time. Double the amount of water as there is beans, plus a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar per cup: see here for why. If you want I can find a more academic source for that but this was the first result on google. I promise it's legit * Pulverize in a food processor (or chop if you like more texture) onions, garlic, carrot, and bell pepper (+/- anything you like) in olive oil. (Use as much veggies as you like, but just know that the more you use the less bean tasting its going to be) * Season with chili powder, pepper, paprika, salt, cumin... Layer the seasonings, so do some when you first start the saute and then another sprinkling once its really soft * Let it all get really soft- cook it low and slow, make sure to stir. * Add the beans and enough water or stock (Last time I used a bunch I had leftover: chicken, beef, pork, and veggie) to cover the beans. Simmer until the beans are cooked. * Puree in a food processor or blender until its smooth. If you want it more bean-y only process a few scoops. This is why I use the food processor to mince the veggies, so it makes it really smooth. For the shrimp I usually use a bit of Sazon seasoning or just pepper and garlic. Lightly saute until pink. Top with a heaping spoonful of sour cream (I personally recommend Trader Joe's organic- OMG the flavor!) or shredded cheese. Or both. Because dairy. Ninja edit: some stuff about soaking

I make mine with some other veggies. I start off by soaking the beans (2 cups) overnight, then rinsing them. Important step! Really improves the digestibility and cooking time. Double the amount of water as there is beans, plus a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar per cup: see here for why. If you want I can find a more academic source for that but this was the first result on google. I promise it's legit * Pulverize in a food processor (or chop if you like more texture) onions, garlic, carrot, and bell pepper (+/- anything you like) in olive oil. (Use as much veggies as you like, but just know that the more you use the less bean tasting its going to be) * Season with chili powder, pepper, paprika, salt, cumin... Layer the seasonings, so do some when you first start the saute and then another sprinkling once its really soft * Let it all get really soft- cook it low and slow, make sure to stir. * Add the beans and enough water or stock (Last time I used a bunch I had leftover: chicken, beef, pork, and veggie) to cover the beans. Simmer until the beans are cooked. * Puree in a food processor or blender until its smooth. If you want it more bean-y only process a few scoops. This is why I use the food processor to mince the veggies, so it makes it really smooth. For the shrimp I usually use a bit of Sazon seasoning or just pepper and garlic. Lightly saute until pink. Top with a heaping spoonful of sour cream (I personally recommend Trader Joe's organic- OMG the flavor!) or shredded cheese. Or both. Because dairy.
