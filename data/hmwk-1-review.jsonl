For a white rice, I usually use Jasmine. The pot I use to cook rice in has a glass lid so I can check it without removing the lid. For 3 cups of cooked rice, rinse 1 cup of uncooked rice and let drain while you bring 2 cups of water to a boil. You could add 1 tsp. chicken, beef or vegetable bouillon base for flavoring if you want. Once the water comes to a boil, stir in the rice, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook 15 - 20 minutes until all of the water has evaporated. If your pot has a glass lid, you can just tilt the pot to see if any water remains.

{"text":"Durability and weight mainly, a plastic board is much more susceptible to being knocked around simply due to being vastly lighter for one. Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.\n'''","response":"DISH: \nEQUIPMENT: plastic board, wood cutting board, cleaver, dishwasher\nINGREDIENT:"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698846823,"_annotator_id":"ner_v2","_session_id":"ner_v2","sessions":["ner_v2"],"default":false}],"view_id":"ner_manual"}

{"text":"Well that's kind of the point of those oils, they should be \"forgettable \" insofar that they don't impart any flavors to the dish. Hence the term neutral oil! Honestly for sauteeing, canola oil is just fine, I wrote it off because it just gets weird when you use it for deep frying, the flavor is off. So I just dont buy it, and grapeseed replaced it. But I agree, olive oil has a tremendous flavor, and it doesn't go with all cuisine types, either. If I'm sauteeing anything for Mexican, Indian, Chinese or other asian food, I'm not using olive oil. I made stovetop popcorn tonight, I don't make it as often as you, but I used my spanish evoo because I prefer it. My uncle used to make stovetop popcorn when I was young and he used some kind of olive oil. We have coconut oil but I never cook with it, I have never been into what i perceive to be a fad, but I am curious as to what you think makes it better?

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size.

A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through.

My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size.

My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.\n'''","response":"DISH: sauce\nINGREDIENT: tomatoes, pasta, fresh herbs, garlic, onions, celery, kosher salt, tomato paste, dry white wine, basil, oregano, parsley, bay leaf, baking soda\nEQUIPMENT: stove top, screened strainer"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698846911,"_annotator_id":"ff47c701-d67c-4c58-bd2e-210f92bba469","_session_id":"88fc32b7-a18f-4ded-909b-e0e513303522","sessions":["88fc32b7-a18f-4ded-909b-e0e513303522"],"default":true},{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes.

My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through.

{"text":"get her a whole mess of tips, and a few different bags. Nothing is worse than cleaning out bags. I would also recommend an offset cake spatula and if you have the money, a rotating cake stand. Fondant doesn't require much in the way of tools, its essentially a sugar dough but with gelatin instead of gluten. So perhaps a decent rolling pin( go to home depot and get a bit of dowel) and a couple of stencils. Also, and this might sound weird, decent saran wrap. Im not talking shit you buy at safeway.

{"text":"Oh, you make it with that magical top cheese crust? Just like Mom! Wonderful. So the dilemma is whether they get that first-night cheese-crust experience or not; whether they want to sit there while it bakes for the first time. Some thoughts: 1) Reheating already-baked lasagna loses the crispness of the crust, but of course the bulk of the lasagna itself only improves after cooking . . . over days, if you ask me. 2) Though, depending on how they'll re-heat; if they use the oven then it might not take *that* much longer to bake it, I dunno? But if they just 'wave it then it's much quicker. 3) If you've already followed that first advice, great!

But if they just 'wave it then it's much quicker. 3) If you've already followed that first advice, great!

{"text":"Sounds like your problem was you were keeping the butter in one of the most variable temp zones of your kitchen. Maybe instead of spending time and money on things like a butter bell, you just don't keep it by the stove in the future? Heck, why not test it in comparison since you *have* the bell now. Try an amount of butter in the bell and the same amount in the traditional butter dish (*not* kept by the stove) and compare their freshness and tendency to mold over time. If there's little to no difference, there's no point in the bell.

{"text":"If you want fairly easy cooking (and you have the available counter space), as well as cooking that translates well into leftovers/packed lunches, I would look into getting a slow cooker. Other than that the bare essentials are a skillet, pot, cutting board, and an oven pan (the stove does come with oven attached yes?). As well as the usual utensils (knives, measuring cups, etc). Those items should get you through most recipes fairly easily. A rice cooker is usually a good buy too since it can do a lot more than just rice. At least as long as the model isn't absolutely ancient. For example most rice cookers come with a steamer basket that you can use to steam a variety of things very easily (veggies, shrimp, pork bao, etc). You can also hard boil eggs as you cook rice (just place the eggs on top of the rice and press cook rice!

{"text":"My method is to start by frying ginger, garlic, and onions. Since you're doing meat you could do that before or after those basic spices. Cook the meat until it is nearly ready, then about 5 minutes before you are done, throw in your sauces and your vegetables. Cover the pan if possible. They only need to steam for a couple minutes usually, longer if not covered. If you have rice noodles that steam instantly you can throw those in for the last 1 minute (again covered) and then you're done. Toss some sesame seeds on and eat up!

{"text":"You should get into quick pickles if you haven't already - so good... easy/fast to make too. Recipe I use is two cups white vinegar, two cups water (hot water helps sugar dissolve), half cup sugar. Mix together and that's your pickling liquid. Chop up hot peppers, red onion, carrots, daikon, whatever veggies you like and put them in a jar with a tight lid. Pack them in there good and then pour in pickling liquid until jar is full. Screw lid on tightly and pop the jar in the fridge for a while (overnight at least). You can add pickles to pretty much any dish (pickled red onions are killer on pork tacos, for example) and they're even good as a stand alone snack - serious punch of flavor (sweet/tangy) and heat (if you're pickling spicy stuff).","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot
