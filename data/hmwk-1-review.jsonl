{"text":"Okay. As an experienced cook, I'll give you a quick rundown of foods that I keep on hand. **Pantry**: all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, honey, baking soda, baking powder, cornmeal, cocoa powder, dried beans (these vary, but usually include black beans, chickpeas, and lentils -- you can sub canned beans if you like), canned tomatoes, tomato paste, tuna, olive oil, grapeseed oil, salad vinegar (usually wine vinegar &amp; balsamic), grains (at least rice and oats, usually a few more), pasta (penne, spaghetti, couscous), tortillas (both corn and wheat), dried fruit, nuts (almonds, walnuts), peanut butter, hot sauce, onions, garlic, potatoes **Fridge:** maple syrup, mustard, mayonnaise, jam, olives, milk, eggs, butter, yeast, cheese (at least cheddar and parmesan), vegetables (these vary but I almost always have carrots, celery, bell peppers, broccoli, and salad greens on hand), fruits (seasonal, right now apples and grapes) **Freezer:** vegetables (peas, edamame, spinach, mixed vegetables), fruit (berries mostly), bone-in chicken breasts, fish (cod, tilapia, etc.), home-made chicken stock **Spices:** salt, pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, bay leaves, cloves, ginger, smoked paprika, cumin, cloves, nutmeg **In the outdoor herb garden:** basil, thyme, sage, marjoram, oregano, parsley, chives, rosemary Obviously, this is not all I keep around for preparing meals, but if you were to peruse my kitchen on any given day, you're pretty much guaranteed to find at least the above.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

{"text":"1.Do I need to reduce pan temperature? Is full heat going to be too much, or will full heat just affect the outer part instead of inside? Keep you Pan hot at first when you grill the skin then reduce it to medium. Just like GrandmaGos said you should then relax. Put a lid on your pan for about 2-3 minutes. Then flip/turn your salmon filet as your recipe says. 2.Frying pan or grill? Does it actually make a real difference, besides aesthetics? Frying pan is probably easiest. 3.Do I need to cover the salmon with a pan or aluminum foil? Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point. Good luck on your dinner!","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point. Good luck on your dinner!","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Zero Shot

Is full heat going to be too much, or will full heat just affect the outer part instead of inside? Keep you Pan hot at first when you grill the skin then reduce it to medium. Just like GrandmaGos said you should then relax. Put a lid on your pan for about 2-3 minutes. Then flip/turn your salmon filet as your recipe says. 2.Frying pan or grill? Does it actually make a real difference, besides aesthetics? Frying pan is probably easiest. 3.Do I need to cover the salmon with a pan or aluminum foil? Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

What most people learn is a specific recipe: how to make this pasta sauce, or that loaf of bread. What about learning how to cook in general? And not just the 'how' but the 'how come?'

Armed with the knowledge of the simple mechanics of a dish, the five or so steps it takes to make it, you can walk into the market, find what's fresh (or on special), bring it home, and have dinner on

{"text":"Everyone will have different needs (obvious from the posts below). How comfortable are you with cooking? Do you enjoy cooking (if you do you will want more kitchen supplies) or do you cook just enough to get by? If you give us more info we can tailor our comments accordingly. That said I will offer up my suggestions as well. (Sorry for the length) Essentials: * Crock pot. - Get one. Seriously. MarkerBear made an excellent point about the amazing feeling of coming home to a warm meal. Plus you will almost always have left overs. If you are cooking for 1 or two a 4 quart crock pot should be enough, any more you might want to upgrade to a 6. * Two frying pans of different sizes - 8\" and 10\" are the most common, though you may want to shoot for a 12\" in case of company/large items. * 2-3 sauce pots. - small medium and large, preferably with lids. If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each. If you have non-stick pots make sure they are wooden or that heavy rubber. * 4 place settings - plates, cups, bowls, utensils. You don't want to have to wash dishes every day. * Pairing knife and a larger knife - These are my all time favorite pairing knives (http://www.amazon.com/Rada-Cutlery-Regular-Paring-Aluminum/dp/B000FZXB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378920414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rada+paring+knife) * Cutting board Like others have said, get your salt and pepper, but then buy spices as you need them. You will learn which to buy in bulk as time goes on. Also buy oil, vinegar, flour, and sugar and keep on hand always. Nice to have: * Toaster Oven - These are great for a fast meal as they don't take so long to heat. * Extra place settings = not having to run the dishwasher as often/wash them by hand so soon * A variety of cooking utensils - same reason as above * Casserole pan * Drying mat - especially in the case of no dishwasher * Full knife set - most people list a chef's knife as essential, I didn't have one in college, and I survived without it, but they are nice to have. * Cast iron is amazing, but I wouldn't call it a \"college student\" requirement. * I also like to keep pasta and sauce, garlic, onions, and potatoes on hand. A great idea, like many have said, is to make extra food and freeze it. I also like to chop onions and potatoes and freeze them as well so prep time in cooking is faster. *Edit: Tried to fix formatting, ended up making it worse.

If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each.

If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each.

How comfortable are you with cooking? Do you enjoy cooking (if you do you will want more kitchen supplies) or do you cook just enough to get by? If you give us more info we can tailor our comments accordingly. That said I will offer up my suggestions as well. (Sorry for the length) Essentials: * Crock pot. - Get one. Seriously. MarkerBear made an excellent point about the amazing feeling of coming home to a warm meal. Plus you will almost always have left overs. If you are cooking for 1 or two a 4 quart crock pot should be enough, any more you might want to upgrade to a 6. * Two frying pans of different sizes - 8\" and 10\" are the most common, though you may want to shoot for a 12\" in case of company/large items. * 2-3 sauce pots. - small medium and large, preferably with lids. If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each. If you have non-stick pots make sure they are wooden or that heavy rubber. * 4 place settings - plates, cups, bowls, utensils. You don't want to have to wash dishes every day. * Pairing knife and a larger knife - These are my all time favorite pairing knives (http://www.amazon.com/Rada-Cutlery-Regular-Paring-Aluminum/dp/B000FZXB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378920414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rada+paring+knife) * Cutting board Like others have said, get your salt and pepper, but then buy spices as you need them. You will learn which to buy in bulk as time goes on. Also buy oil, vinegar, flour, and sugar and keep on hand always. Nice to have: * Toaster Oven - These are great for a fast meal as they don't take so long to heat. * Extra place settings = not having to run the dishwasher as often/wash them by hand so soon * A variety of cooking utensils - same reason as above * Casserole pan * Drying mat - especially in the case of no dishwasher * Full knife set - most people list a chef's knife as essential, I didn't have one in college, and I survived without it, but they are nice to have. * Cast iron is amazing, but I wouldn't call it a \"college student\" requirement. * I also like to keep pasta and sauce, garlic, onions, and potatoes on hand. A great idea, like many have said, is to make extra food and freeze it. I also like to chop onions and potatoes and freeze them as well so prep time in cooking is faster. *Edit: Tried to fix formatting, ended up making it worse.

{"text":"I've worked as a line cook for the past two summers, and have been going to university the rest of the time. To answer your question, I'd say you'd learn a huge deal working on line. I learned time management and optimization skills that are transferable from restaurant kitchens to chemistry labs. Plus, you'll also pick up fundamentals of food prep and safety, knife skills and care, etc. to say the least. So yes, it has certainly helped me and I'd say it would you too. In terms of actually getting a job with that chunk of time, it really depends on the season you apply in (if the restaurant has seasonal spikes in business) and the quality of that restaurant. Most likely you'll have to either spend a chunk of time in the dish pit or at the bottom of the line before really getting the skills you're looking for. I worked my way up from the dish pit and was offered a spot on the second highest station on line in two summers, so it can certainly be done. My advice, apply everywhere you can ASAP.

To answer your question, I'd say you'd learn a huge deal working on line. I learned time management and optimization skills that are transferable from restaurant kitchens to chemistry labs. Plus, you'll also pick up fundamentals of food prep and safety, knife skills and care, etc. to say the least. So yes, it has certainly helped me and I'd say it would you too. In terms of actually getting a job with that chunk of time, it really depends on the season you apply in (if the restaurant has seasonal spikes in business) and the quality of that restaurant. Most likely you'll have to either spend a chunk of time in the dish pit or at the bottom of the line before really getting the skills you're looking for. I worked my way up from the dish pit and was offered a spot on the second highest station on line in two summers, so it can certainly be done. My advice, apply everywhere you can ASAP.

Then add the vinegar to taste. It's actually the way we do it at the restaurant I work at. We make a big batch of all the herbs, garlic and oil, season it, and then very finely dice some red onion and marinate it in red wine vinegar (to cover). When someone wants a side of chimichurri, we spoon some of the herb/oil mix into a bowl, and then add some of the onion/vinegar to taste. Keeping them separate this way is preferrable in a restaurant setting because without the acid, the herbs will stay green and bright for days, whereas if they were mixed with the acid they would turn color within the hour.\n'''","response":"DISH: chimichurri\nEQUIPMENT: bowl\nINGREDIENT: oil, herbs, garlic, vinegar, red onion, red wine vinegar"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_session_id":"hmwk_1_zeroshot","sessions":["hmwk_1_zeroshot"],"default":false}],"view_id":"ner_manual","_timestamp":1707939970}
